I've been very interested in the implementation of [SparkRecordingCircle](https://github.com/subjc/SparkRecordingCircle). So I rewrote it in Swift to learn its implementation and also practise iOS programming. The original version is written in Objective-C by [Sam Page](https://github.com/sampage).

SparkRecordingCircle
======================

A clone of [Spark Camera](https://www.sparkcamera.com/)'s recording meter. 

Built for the [Spark Camera's recording meter](http://subjc.com/spark-camera/) post on [Subjective-C](http://subjc.com).
